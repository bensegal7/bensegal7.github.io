# About me

My name is Ben! I'm a data analyst with experience in SQL, R, and Excel. Most recently, I graduated from the University of New Hampshire's full-time MBA program, and am looking forward to finding my next role. In my free time, I like to hike, camp, play video games, and train jiu-jitsu.
